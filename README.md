# Hello there, I'm Bryan! :man_technologist: :v:

I'm an aspiring front-end web developer who is passionate about clean design and even cleaner code. I work with Javascript and the React framework to build fantastic projects. My end goal is to find teams / projects that promote positive social engineering and environmental changes to create a better world.

Currently I am..
  - Looking for a front-end web developer position
  - Getting better at the React.js library
  - Just finished building a world flag flashcard app
  - Building a recreation of the Monkey Island insult sword fighting game
  - Planning a mass-pricing tool for the American textbook industry
  - Traveling the world, practicing bachata, and doing my best to learn some Georgian
