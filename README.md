# Hello there, I'm Bryan! :man_technologist: :v:

I'm an American front-end web developer who is currently living in the Republic of Georgia. I work with Javascript and React.js to build fantastic projects and solve real world problems.

Currently I am..
  - Looking for a front-end web developer position
  - Getting better at the React.js library
  - Just finished building a Gatsby-powered website from a PSD mockup, and a Monkey Island series minigame
  - Redesigning my personal website and looking for more API-based projects
  - Traveling the world, practicing bachata, and doing my best to learn some Georgian
