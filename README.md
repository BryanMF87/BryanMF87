## Hello there, I'm Bryan! 

I'm an aspiring front-end software engineer who is passionate about clean design and even cleaner code. I work with Bootstrap and React frameworks to build fantastic projects. My end goal is to find teams / projects that promote positive social engineering and environmental changes.

Currently I am..
  - Creating my portfolio website using React and Bootstrap
  - Learning more complex React Hooks
  - Building a Monkey Island themed Battleship JS game
  - Studying Spanish and practicing Jui Jitsu
