# Hello there, I'm Bryan! :man_technologist: :v:

I'm an aspiring front-end software engineer who is passionate about clean design and even cleaner code. I work with Bootstrap and React frameworks to build fantastic projects. My end goal is to find teams / projects that promote positive social engineering and environmental changes to create a better world.

Currently I am..
  - Looking for a remote, full-time developer position
  - Learning more complex React Hooks
  - Building a Monkey Island themed Battleship JS game
  - Studying Spanish, Georgian, and practicing Jui Jitsu
